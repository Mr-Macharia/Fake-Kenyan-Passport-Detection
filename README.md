# Fake Kenyan Passport Detection

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system for detecting fake Kenyan passports by leveraging image analysis techniques. The need for such a system is driven by the increased travel and job-seeking activities involving Kenyan passports. With an effective detection mechanism, the system can help authorities and travelers identify counterfeit documents, ensuring security and authenticity in travel documentation.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to build an application that can automatically differentiate between genuine and fake Kenyan passports using image recognition and analysis.

## Motivation

Kenya has seen a surge in international travel and job opportunities, which has unfortunately might lead to an increase in counterfeit passport usage. Detecting these fakes manually is challenging, thus creating a tool that automates this process can enhance security and efficiency.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the initial stages of development and therefore I am still in analysis. We have used two sample images — one of a genuine Kenyan passport and one of a counterfeit — to begin testing. Initial findings suggest that the genuine passport is less clear than the fake one, which presents a challenge in distinguishing between the two.

## Requirements

To proceed with this project, the following resources and data are needed:
- High-resolution images of genuine Kenyan passports.
- Samples of fake Kenyan passports for training and testing.

## Next Steps

1. **Acquire High-Quality Data**: Obtain clearer and more diverse images of both genuine and fake Kenyan passports.
2. **Develop Detection Algorithms**: Build and train models to detect inconsistencies and features typical of fake passports.
3. **Build the Application**: Develop a user-friendly application that integrates the detection algorithms.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Test the application with various passport images to ensure accuracy and reliability.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the application for use by relevant authorities and individuals.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! If you have access to high-quality passport images, suggestions for improving the detection algorithms, or any other relevant expertise, please reach out or submit a pull request.
